jack-midi2tty
=============

A simple program to listen on midi in jack and dump the data to terminal.

This is the first thing I've put on github that is actually useful ;)

Building
--------

  - Depends on libjack
  - `make`

Usage
-----

  - `./midi2tty`

And it will dump the midi data to stdout
